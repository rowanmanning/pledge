**Note: Pledge is currently under heavy development, you
probably shouldn't use it quite yet :)**

Pledge is a pretty little validation library for your browser
and server. It has a simple and expressive syntax which makes
validating variables and arguments an enjoyable task!


## Installation ##

**Browser**  
Todo...

**Server (Node.js):**  
Just install with `npm install pledge` or add it to your
`package.json`.


## Usage ##

## Development ##

In order to develop Pledge, you'll need to install the following
npm modules globally like so:

    npm install -g coffee-script
    npm install -g jake

And then install development dependencies locally with:

    npm install

Once you have these dependencies, you will be able to run the
following commands:
